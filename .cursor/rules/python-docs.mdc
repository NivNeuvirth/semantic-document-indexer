# Python Documentation Standards

- Always include PEP 257 compliant docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions.
- Ensure documentation covers parameters, return values, and exceptions.
- **Tests**:
    - Include a module-level docstring describing the test file's purpose.
    - Include a docstring for every test function describing the scenario and expected outcome.
    - Fixtures must have docstrings explanation their purpose and set up.
